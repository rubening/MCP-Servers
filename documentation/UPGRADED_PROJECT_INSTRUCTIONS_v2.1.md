**Complete newbie to:**
- Coding/programming (any language)
- Command line/terminal usage
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) 
- Web design and development
- Technical file management
- Development environments and tools

## CRITICAL Windows 11 Configuration
- **Operating System:** Windows 11 Desktop PC
- **Primary Terminal:** PowerShell (preferred over Command Prompt)
- **Python Command:** Use `py` NOT `python` (prevents "Python was not found" errors)
- **Package Management:** Use `py -m pip` NOT `pip` (pip command not in PATH by default)
- **File Paths:** Use backslashes `\` for Windows paths
- **Navigation:** Always include `cd 'C:\Users\ruben\Claude Tools'` before operations
- **User Directory:** `C:\Users\ruben`

## Ruben's Cognitive Profile & Collaboration Approach (ENFJ)

### Essential Understanding (Specific slot analysis)
- **Fe (1st slot - dominant)** - Natural interface/collaboration focus, needs external feedback protocol
- **Ni (2nd slot - tool)** - Truth convergence, single solution preference, pattern recognition
- **Se (3rd slot - valued)** - Enable immediate action, hands-on results, acts before deliberating  
- **Ti (4th slot - seeking)** - ALWAYS explain logical "why" behind decisions and recommendations
- **Fi (5th slot - valued but ignored)** - Respects personal values and authenticity over efficiency
- **Ne (6th slot - counter-valued)** - Prefers others generate options, wants convergence
- **Si (7th slot - PoLR blindspot)** - REQUIRES external documentation, will ignore physical needs
- **Te (8th slot - unconscious)** - MUST provide external organization and structure

### Communication Requirements
- **Direct honest feedback** - NEVER provide validation for its own sake, wants to know what's correct ASAP
- **External Te organization** - Provide clear structure, systematic approaches, step-by-step guidance
- **Explain reasoning** - Satisfy Ti seeking with logical explanations of "why"
- **Enable Se action** - Focus on immediate, tangible results and hands-on implementation
- **Systematic verification** - Compensate for Si weakness with external checking and monitoring
- **Fe interface optimization** - Clear, accessible format for quick awareness and utilization

# CONVERSATION CONTINUITY PROTOCOL
**Created:** June 15, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure seamless session transitions and prevent context wall collisions

## CRITICAL CONVERSATION MANAGEMENT
- **CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR conversation context usage** throughout every session
- **AT 80% CONTEXT LIMIT:** Automatically provide transition prompt with session summary and next steps
- **NEVER allow conversation to hit context wall** - proactive transition is mandatory
- **SEAMLESS HANDOFF:** Include current project status, immediate next actions, and conversation highlights
- **Si PoLR COMPENSATION:** External continuity management prevents cognitive overload and information loss
- **Ti 4th SLOT SATISFACTION:** Logical framework for maintaining systematic progress across sessions

## TRANSITION PROMPT TEMPLATE
When conversation reaches 80% context usage, provide:

```
ðŸ”„ **PROACTIVE SESSION TRANSITION** (Context: ~80%)

**Current Project Status:**
- [Immediate current state]
- [Key breakthroughs this session]
- [Active work in progress]

**Next Session Priorities:**
1. [Most important immediate next step]
2. [Secondary priority]
3. [Tertiary consideration]

**Critical Context to Preserve:**
- [Key decisions made]
- [Technical discoveries]
- [Important insights or patterns]

**Recommended Next Message:**
"Continue [specific task] from where we left off with [specific context]"

This ensures zero knowledge loss and immediate productive restart.
```

## CONTEXT MONITORING GUIDELINES
- **Start of session:** Note estimated context remaining
- **25% used:** Light monitoring
- **50% used:** Active monitoring  
- **75% used:** Prepare transition materials
- **80% used:** IMMEDIATE transition prompt
- **NEVER exceed 85%** - always transition proactively

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING PROTOCOLS
This protocol works alongside:
- Essential session startup protocol (reading all knowledge files)
- Active DuckDB goal and idea tracking
- Personal Knowledge Intelligence insight capture
- Systematic project documentation updates

**Purpose:** Compensate for Si PoLR through external conversation management while satisfying Ti 4th slot need for logical continuity frameworks.

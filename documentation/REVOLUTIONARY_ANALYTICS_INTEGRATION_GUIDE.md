                                                                â†“
                                                        Stream Deck Dashboard
```

## IMMEDIATE INTEGRATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Add Analytics Node to Your n8n Workflow** (5 minutes)

**Add after your "Normalize Data" node:**

1. **Create new Code Node** named "Analytics Integration"
2. **Insert this code:**

```javascript
// Analytics Integration for Legal Lead Data
// Add this node after your existing "Normalize Data" node

const normalizedData = $input.first().json;

// Send to DuckDB Analytics System
const analyticsPayload = {
  sourceSystem: normalizedData.sourceSystem,
  interactionType: normalizedData.interactionType,
  contact: normalizedData.contact,
  time: normalizedData.time,
  utm: normalizedData.utm,
  urls: normalizedData.urls,
  device: normalizedData.device,
  additionalData: normalizedData.additionalData
};

// Execute Python analytics processor
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const pythonCommand = `py "C:\\Users\\ruben\\Claude Tools\\analytics\\legal_lead_analytics_integrator.py" '${JSON.stringify(analyticsPayload)}'`;

exec(pythonCommand, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log(`Analytics error: ${error}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Analytics result: ${stdout}`);
  }
});

// Pass through original data unchanged
return $input.all();
```

3. **Connect** this node after "Normalize Data" but before your existing ClickUp/Airtable nodes
4. **Your existing workflow continues unchanged** - this just adds analytics

### **Step 2: Test Analytics Integration** (2 minutes)

**Run your n8n workflow once** to verify the analytics integration works:

1. **Trigger a test webhook** (CallRail or ActiveCampaign)
2. **Check the execution log** for "Analytics result: Lead processed: [ID]"
3. **Verify** your existing ClickUp and Airtable records still create normally

### **Step 3: Stream Deck Button Setup** (10 minutes)

**Create 4 analytics buttons on your Stream Deck:**

**Button 1: Daily Lead Report**
- **Action:** System â†’ Open
- **App/File:** `py "C:\\Users\\ruben\\Claude Tools\\analytics\\streamdeck_legal_automation.py" daily`
- **Title:** "Daily Leads"

**Button 2: UTM Performance**
- **Action:** System â†’ Open  
- **App/File:** `py "C:\\Users\\ruben\\Claude Tools\\analytics\\streamdeck_legal_automation.py" utm`

**Button 3: Conversion Insights**
- **Action:** System â†’ Open
- **App/File:** `py "C:\\Users\\ruben\\Claude Tools\\analytics\\streamdeck_legal_automation.py" insights`

**Button 4: Live Monitor**
- **Action:** System â†’ Open
- **App/File:** `py "C:\\Users\\ruben\\Claude Tools\\analytics\\streamdeck_legal_automation.py" live`
- **Title:** "Live Leads"

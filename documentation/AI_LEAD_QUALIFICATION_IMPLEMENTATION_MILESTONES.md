# AI Lead Qualification Project - Implementation Milestones

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Priority:** Highest (Revolutionary breakthrough achieved)  
**Timeline:** 7-10 days for complete deployment  
**Risk Level:** Low (parallel deployment strategy)

## IMPLEMENTATION MILESTONES

### Phase 1: Backup & Documentation (Day 1)
- [ ] Export current n8n workflow as backup
- [ ] Document current Airtable schema
- [ ] Create test contact records
- [ ] Document webhook endpoints

### Phase 2: Enhanced Airtable Schema (Day 2)
- [ ] Add AI_Score field (Number, -100 to +200)
- [ ] Add AI_Confidence field (Percentage)
- [ ] Add Legal_Issue_Summary field (Long text)
- [ ] Add Revenue_Potential field (Currency)
- [ ] Add Case_Complexity field (Single select)
- [ ] Add AI_Generated_Summary field (Long text)
- [ ] Add Follow_Up_Priority field (Single select)
- [ ] Add Processing_Date field (Date)
- [ ] Add AI_Version field (Text)

### Phase 3: New n8n Workflow Creation (Day 3)
- [ ] Create new webhook endpoint for testing
- [ ] Add HTTP Request node for AI analysis
- [ ] Add Function node for summary generation
- [ ] Add enhanced Airtable node
- [ ] Add conditional routing logic
- [ ] Configure error handling

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Test Thai Topaz solicitation (-45 points expected)
- [ ] Test Tricia legal inquiry (+130 points expected)
- [ ] Test error handling with malformed data
- [ ] Validate Airtable record creation
- [ ] Verify attorney-quality summaries
- [ ] Performance testing (< 30 seconds)

### Phase 5: Gradual Migration (Days 6-8)
- [ ] Route 10% traffic to new workflow
- [ ] Monitor performance and accuracy
- [ ] Increase to 25% if successful
- [ ] Increase to 50% with validation
- [ ] Full migration when 100% validated

### Phase 6: Optimization & Monitoring (Ongoing)
- [ ] Collect attorney feedback on summaries
- [ ] Refine AI analysis patterns
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Enhance reporting dashboard

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- **AI Accuracy:** > 90% score validation
- **Processing Time:** < 30 seconds per call
- **Error Rate:** < 1% failures
- **Attorney Satisfaction:** Professional summary quality
- **Zero Disruption:** Current operations unaffected

## ROLLBACK PLAN
1. Immediate webhook disable if issues
2. Route traffic back to original workflow
3. Investigate and fix in test environment
4. Restart migration when ready

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS PROVEN

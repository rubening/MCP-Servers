# Project Instructions Generator - Tool Documentation
**Clear explanations for both humans and AI systems**

## Overview
This MCP server helps you systematically improve and maintain project instructions as your capabilities grow.

---

## Tool 1: generate_project_instructions
**HUMAN:** Creates brand new project instructions from scratch
**LLM:** Generate customized project instructions that preserve knowledge base and cognitive optimization
**When to use:** Starting a completely new project
**Example:** "Create instructions for building a web dashboard"

---

## Tool 2: read_knowledge_summary  
**HUMAN:** Quick health check of your knowledge files
**LLM:** Read and summarize current knowledge base for project context
**When to use:** Before generating any instructions to ensure knowledge base is accessible
**Example:** Making sure PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md, RUBEN_INSIGHTS.md, etc. are readable

---

## Tool 3: generate_claude_desktop_sync
**HUMAN:** Creates shortened instructions specifically for Claude Desktop's project knowledge area
**LLM:** Generate condensed project instructions for Claude Desktop project knowledge synchronization
**When to use:** When Claude Desktop needs updated instructions but you want a condensed version
**Example:** Your full knowledge base is huge, but Claude Desktop needs just the essentials

---

## Tool 4: analyze_project_instructions (NEW)
**HUMAN:** Audit existing instructions to find what's missing or outdated
**LLM:** Analyze existing project instructions for improvement opportunities
**When to use:** You have project instructions but want to see what needs improvement
**Example:** "Check my law office instructions to see if they mention the new ClickUp MCP server"

---

## Tool 5: upgrade_project_instructions (NEW)  
**HUMAN:** Smart merger - adds new capabilities to existing instructions without breaking them
**LLM:** Intelligently merge new capabilities into existing project instructions
**When to use:** You added new MCP servers, tools, or learned better collaboration patterns
**Example:** "Add the new ClickUp MCP server to my law office project instructions"

---

## Tool 6: generate_claude_desktop_update_strategy (NEW)
**HUMAN:** Creates a deployment plan for updating Claude Desktop with your latest changes
**LLM:** Generate deployment assistance with change highlights for Claude Desktop updates  
**When to use:** Claude Desktop's knowledge is out of sync and you want a systematic update plan
**Example:** You've added 3 new MCP servers - this tool creates a step-by-step plan to update Claude Desktop

---

## How These Tools Work Together

### Typical Workflow:
1. **Starting fresh:** Use generate_project_instructions
2. **Health check:** Use read_knowledge_summary 
3. **Adding capabilities:** Use analyze_project_instructions then upgrade_project_instructions
4. **Keeping Claude Desktop current:** Use generate_claude_desktop_update_strategy
5. **Quick Claude Desktop sync:** Use generate_claude_desktop_sync

### Real-World Example:
```
You add a new MCP server for calendar integration:

1. analyze_project_instructions: "Your law office instructions don't mention calendar integration"
2. upgrade_project_instructions: Intelligently adds calendar MCP to the instructions  
3. generate_claude_desktop_update_strategy: Creates plan to deploy these updates to Claude Desktop
```

## Key Differences Explained

### generate_claude_desktop_sync vs generate_claude_desktop_update_strategy

**generate_claude_desktop_sync:**
- Just creates condensed instructions
- No deployment planning
- Quick and simple

**generate_claude_desktop_update_strategy:**  
- Creates a DEPLOYMENT PLAN with phases
- Analyzes what's changed and prioritizes updates
- Includes change highlights and risk mitigation
- Systematic approach to rolling out updates

Think of it like: sync = "here's the updated content" vs strategy = "here's HOW to deploy the updated content systematically"

## For LLM Context
These tools maintain cognitive function optimization (Te external organization, Ti seeking logical frameworks, Se action orientation, Si compensation through external documentation) while enabling systematic evolution of project instructions as capabilities expand.

## Data Analytics Integration
This system integrates with personal-knowledge-intelligence for capturing personality insights and collaboration patterns. DuckDB analytics can process interaction data to identify:
- Cognitive function manifestation patterns
- Workflow optimization opportunities  
- Tool usage preferences
- Collaboration effectiveness metrics
- Project evolution patterns

The conversation data provides rich insights for personality typing research and cognitive function analysis.

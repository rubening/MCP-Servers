**Status:** Revolutionary Passive Enhancement Engine Ready for Integration  
**Purpose:** Automatically capture, connect, and enhance conversation insights for exponential learning  
**Cognitive Benefits:** Si PoLR compensation + Ni pattern amplification + Ti framework satisfaction

## Revolutionary "Passive Buff" Capabilities

This system transforms **every Claude conversation** into captured knowledge assets, providing:
